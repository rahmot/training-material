&lt;p&gt;As such we’ve exposed a very minimal API with a lot of the metadata from the GTN allowing you to list tutorials, find topics and tutorials that are interesting, and render these in external sites or use in a programatic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey should take less than 10 minutes and every questions are optional and can be skipped. It will help us prioritise improvements to the training materials. We’re currently focused on making it easier to prepare and give trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

Writing the tutorials was always a bit awkward as you would spend a lot of time writing code blocks that would be copied and pasted by students into a terminal. We thought we could do better than that, so we decided we would try to convert these to Jupyter Notebooks where the students could read the training materials and simultaneously execute the code cells directly there with the text!

&lt;p&gt;The answers are automatically posted to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;. With &amp;gt; 1,300 answers, it is quite difficult to keep an eye on the answers, specially because the answers there are for all tutorials, but also to have an overview of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we have the feedback for a specific tutorial? Or for all the tutorials for a topic? How many feedback has been submitted? Are the tutorials appreciated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer some of these questions and help contributors, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/feedback.html&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; which aggregate all feedback, display them globally, but also by topic and tutorials, including the free text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data from the feedback are automatically extracted every week to update the page and its graphs. The page is linked in the “Extras” menu on the top (with direct link to interesting section from topic and tutorial pages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our community members suggested on twitter that we support alternative formats for accessing our JavaScript based slides, as this can be difficult for users using screen readers. We’ve now added support for “plain text slides”, where we render the slide decks as a single long document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rendering is imperfect, due to how our slide deck library handles custom classes within slides, but it should still be an improvement for anyone who wants to scroll through the slides in an alternative format. You can find them linked from the first slide of each slide deck, or from the slides dropdown in the topic pages, &lt;em&gt;check them out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally we’ve made a number of other minor accessibility improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed 533 missing alt texts for images&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed some repetitive icon names names when followed immediately by their descriptive text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove repetitive image labels on author badges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these were done after (
