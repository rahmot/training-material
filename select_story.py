story_list = {"Housekeeping” by Natasha Tretheway": """We mourn the broken things, chair legs wrenched from their seats, chipped plates,
the threadbare clothes. We work the magic
of glue, drive the nails, mend the holes.
We save what we can, melt small pieces
of soap, gather fallen pecans, keep neck bones
for soup. Beating rugs against the house,
we watch dust, lit like stars, spreading
across the yard. Late afternoon, we draw
the blinds to cool the rooms, drive the bugs
out. My mother irons, singing, lost in reverie.
I mark the pages of a mail-order catalog,
listen for passing cars. All day we watch
for the mail, some news from a distant place;""", 

"“The Rose Family” by Robert Frost":
"""The rose is a rose,
And was always a rose.
But the theory now goes
That the apple’s a rose,
And the pear is, and so’s
The plum, I suppose.
The dear only knows
What will next prove a rose.
You, of course, are a rose –
But were always a rose.""",

"Spring Again by Jess Taylor":
"""Light shining through swiss chard.
My second March without a backyard, and while yes, I miss things about the last place we rented together (especially the thick grass where the girls ran circles), our first rental is what I keep conjuring. 
The explosion of chard and arugula, us battling the spotted cucumber beetles, our wedding altar next to the garden beds.
Now I plant greens in wine barrels outside my duplex, the girls kicking balls up the concrete alley, me with tender starts and spade, 
and I remember us wild—before marriage and kids, before resentments took root—when we were just churning the soil.""",

"Summer Evening By Walter De La Mare":
  """The sandy cat by the Farmer's chair
   Mews at his knee for dainty fare;
  Old Rover in his moss-greened house
  Mumbles a bone, and barks at a mouse
  In the dewy fields the cattle lie
  Chewing the cud 'neath a fading sky
 Dobbin at manger pulls his hay:
 Gone is another summer's day.""",

"Magic Touch by Annie McMahon":
"""From my hotel room window, I see an oversized billboard with his face on it: Jason, the Great Magician.
I absent-mindedly turn the pages of the phone book and come across a city map. Sipping my iced latté, I run my fingers along the streets from the hotel to the opera hall. Not more than a half-hour walk.
I glance at the clock. The show starts in one hour. Plenty of time! I gulp the last three sips of my latté and hop in the shower. Soon I’m on my way to the show, carrying a fancy black handbag and a genuine smile.
The billboard looks even more impressive from outside. The Great Jason's eyes seem to be glancing through me. I shiver and walk faster. I feel like a child about to open her birthday presents.
The hall is dark when I come in; the show is about to begin. I make my way backstage just as the great magician puts on his top hat.
"Daddy, I'm so glad to see you," I say in a half-whisper. "I'm in town for the writer's workshop, but I just couldn't miss your show." I give him a quick hug and go back into the seating area, leaving him with a startled smile. I settle down in the darkness, and the curtains open.
Magically, that show remains the Great Jason's best performance to this day.""",

"Mysterious Stranger by Annie McMahon":
"""He really did look like a tourist, with a camera around his neck and a bottle of sunscreen sticking out of his tote bag.

The portly man sat on the terrace, sipping lemonade and pretending to look at a glossy cruise brochure. His sunglasses masked his eyes, but I knew he wasn't looking at the brochure: he hadn't turned a page for the last ten minutes.

As I brought him his clam chowder, he coughed up a "thank you" and looked at me briefly. I tried not to stare at the tiny scar across his left eyebrow.

I walked back inside with my empty tray, shaking my head. He looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place him.

Then it hit me. The car accident. The mysterious stranger who helped me out of my smashed car, just before it exploded. I rushed back to his table.

He was gone.

I moved his saucer and found his tip, along with a card:

I am deeply indebted to you. The night of your car accident, I was on my way to rob a jewelry store. Saving your life brought things back in perspective. I now live an honest life, thanks to you. God bless you! Mr. D.

I shivered. The night of my car accident, I was heading for an interview in a shady dance club. Seeing human kindness through his heroic gesture turned my life around and brought faith back into my life.

I unfolded the tip he left. Among the singles was a grand with a pen mark underlining "In God We Trust."

I said a silent prayer for him and got back to work, smiling.""",

"Spiritual Thunderstorm by Annie McMahon":
"""I stepped outside into a gorgeous summer day. The sun made everything look bright and cheerful. It would have been an ideal day for a picnic—if I still had a special someone to picnic with.

Nobody would have suspected the thunderstorm going on inside my heart. Lightnings illuminated hidden emotions briefly, followed by a clasp of crushed hopes. Droplets of internal tears poured down, washing off what remained of my romantic dreams.

I sat at the bus stop with a book, reading the same paragraph for the fifth time and trying to look indifferent to my internal weather patterns. Sunglasses masked my puffy eyes and returned the reflection of a nearby flower. I will never love again. Love is just an illusion leading nowhere.

I was so absorbed in my thoughts, I didn't notice the man taking a seat beside me.

"Excuse me, Miss, but I couldn't help noticing that you're reading O. Henry. He's my favorite author."

His deep voice startled me. His friendly smile warmed up my damp heart and blew away some of the storm clouds.

"He's my favorite as well." I tried to return his smile.

We spent the next fifteen minutes talking about literature and its influence in today's culture. The bus came and went. We pretended not to notice.

"By the way, my name is Mark." As his warm hand shook mine, an electric current coursed through me.

"Do you care to join me for lunch?" he added, ignoring my blushing cheeks. "Let's start all over again, shall we? I'm sorry about this morning."

A rainbow appeared, leading the way to a heart of gold. I followed it.""",

"County Fair Refreshments by Annie McMahon":
"""Isabella loved the county fair, with all the flashy colors, the sounds of music and laughter, and the cotton candy smell. After trying a few rides and earning prizes at the ring toss, she noticed a small crowd near the ferris wheel. People were gathered so tightly she couldn’t see what was happening.

Isabella and her elder brother Michael made their way as close as possible and stretched their necks. People were gasping and laughing, whispering and yelping.

Mr. Murphy, the school principal, burst out of the crowd, dripping wet. He was laughing too, wringing his soaked baseball cap and putting his glasses back on.

"How's the water, Mr. Murphy?" Mayor Johnson asked, holding a lemonade.

"Just fine, just fine!" the wet principal answered cheerfully. "You'll find out soon enough!"

Mayor Johnson's smile faded, and he looked worriedly around him, provoking another round of laughter. "I can't be next, I'm in charge of the tank. Now we need a new volunteer! Any volunteer?"

As people moved away from the dunk tank to mingle and talk, Isabella wondered who would be next. She secretly hoped it would be her second grade teacher.

"Michael, look!" she said, louder than she intended. A raccoon had climbed in and stood on the chair.

"We have a volunteer!" The mayor’s loud voice overpowered the crowd's. "Three tickets give you five balls!"

Several people lined up to try their luck.

"How did it get in there?" Isabella whispered to Michael.

Before she could wonder any longer, she heard a big splash. A soaking wet raccoon dashed between her and Michael, holding Mr. Murphy's leftover candied apple in its mouth.""",

"The moving Star by Rahmot Afolabi":
"""Oh, Ye Ah!
Moving gradually through the clouded sky
Winking joy in my heart
Very small but significant
Among many other stars
Millions of stars beautify the sky at night
But thou are different
You appear once and disappear into the cloud
Ye appear again in different positions
Your uniqueness is an omen of peace
Thousands of stars remain sparkling 
But you choose to be daring and glaring
Your bravery left me in wonders
Thy scintillation lulls me to comfort
Verily, you lack no oomph
Curiosity overflows my mind
Are you moving forward to become the biggest star or even the Moon!
This mystery, I can't still unravel.
You are indeed a twinkle moving star
Remain the moving star you are!"""
